# About

This is my 'getting started' with Django. Primarily
based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p)
series of videos and [this](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Django_Blog) repo.
In addition to basic blog features, the API was added for allowing interaction with a site through a
[telegram bot](https://t.me/django_blog_echo_bot).
The project and the bot are hosted as one Heroku app, on two different dynos.
